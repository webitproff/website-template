# FIles structure

All folders you see here are the website template names.

- nature-craft

Go deep one level. Each one contains codes or framework name, that I use to make the website.

# How to download

According to the [issue](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7106012/download-a-single-folder-or-directory-from-a-github-repo). Seem like it does not have direct way to download which template. However there're work around.

1. Go to the folder, the template that you want to download.

1. Then copy the URL, for example will look something like `https://github.com/zummon/website-template/tree/master/sunlight-interior/html`. 

1. Open [Download Directory](https://download-directory.github.io/) web app.

1. Paste the link in the input bar, and hit enter to begin downloading.

Or other strategy that you usually do.
